WORKING TITLE - NOT-SO-SMART FRIDGE

A VERY BASIC PYTHON APP I HAVE PUT TOGETHER

IT STARTS WITH A LIST OF ITEMS CONTAINED
IN A HYPOTHETICAL NOT-SO-SMART FRIDGE
THE USER IS THEN PROMTED VIA THE TERMINAL
TO SEARCH THE FRIDGE FOR A PARTICULAR ITEM.
IF IT EXISTS IT LETS YOU KNOW AND THEN MOVES ON
IF IT DOESN'T IT PROMPTS YOU TO ADD THE ITEM TO THE FRIDGE
IT ALSO GIVES YOU AN OPTION TO REMOVE AN ITEM
